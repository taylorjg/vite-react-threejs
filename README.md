# Description

A little [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) app with these features:

* The project was scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* Uses custom shaders that are imported as static assets
  * See [Importing Asset as String](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets#importing-asset-as-string)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [MUI](https://mui.com/)

# TODO

* Extend the app to support a few different shapes and a few different colours
* Allow the initial shape and colour to be specified via query params
* Add a settings panel to allow the shape and colour to be changed
* Allow the shape and colour to be changed via the keyboard too
